# Selective-Repeat on UDP Protocol

## Testing Suite

This project will use [Criterion](https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion) as a testing suite, enabling us to mock objects and write
elegant and useful tests on the program.

Please install Criterion in order to run tests. Criterion's lib is included like any other C library.
